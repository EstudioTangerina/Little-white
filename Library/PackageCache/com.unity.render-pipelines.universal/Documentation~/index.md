# The documentation has moved to the Unity Manual

The documentation for the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) in Unity 6 Preview has moved to the [Unity Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/urp-introduction.html).

The [scripting API](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@17.0/api/index.html) documentation is still on this website.
