Guys, I found this girl here near the big tree, she seems to be fine…
<color=#853A24>Was she unconscious and alone? Where did she come from?</color>
<color=#853A24>It's strange that she doesn't have any dirt on her clothes...</color>
You're right... But I couldn't leave her there if apparently they are nearby.
<color=#D25230>SHE MAY BE ALLIED TO THEM!!! ARREST HER AND CALL THE KINGDOM SOLDIERS!!</color>
<color=#5FAB2A>Miliaaa... please calm down...
We won't know who she is until she wakes up...</color>
Ofélia is right, she will remain in my care and I will see what she plans.
